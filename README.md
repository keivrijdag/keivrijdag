## History

### First era: 2014-2015

Giacomonday started in the era in which TECE was a member of COCON. In that era,
Richel Bilderbeek and Annelies van Ginkel were the two Party Committee members.
During that period, the pub was frequented once a week for six weeks in a row. Then,
Giacomo Alciatore, an examplary student went elsewhere. This resulted in Richel being
in the pub alone, and Giacomonday (not yet called as such) died a silent death. Also,
TECE split from COCON.

### Second era: 2016

In the second era, Giacomo visited Groningen for some weeks, and Giacomonday was
back! It was then named as such. When Giacomo left, Richel was again the only
one persevering in being social, and Giacomonday was put in the freezer.

### Third era: 2017-onwards

The TECE group has grown, with some new social members being added. Giacomonday
was revived, with Giacomono being absent (he does get the invitation email, though).
The Giacomonday got a more serious character, by adding a scientific topic to 
be informally discussed.
