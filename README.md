## FAQ

### At what time will the topic be discussed?

Discussion starts at 20:00 sharp, until a 
consensus is reached. Sometimes the discussion
flares up again later on the evening, but this
is not encouraged.

### I know little about the topic, can I join anyways?

Great care is taken in selecting topics with only
a modest amount of literature about it. If a literature
search on the topic results in more articles 
than the Giacoconstant, a more specific topic is picked. 

Short as the list of academic papers may be, 
we do (try to) accept people 
that may potentially have good reasons not to read up.

### I want to contribute a topic

Great! Send a Pull Request, Issue or email to @richelbilderbeek.

### I only want to join for the gezelligheid. Is that OK?

As can be inferred from the list of topics, we do not
take science lightly. Sure, we will (try to) be nice
to you, but we may be hindered of the idea that we 
view you as parasitically bathing in our hard-earned 
wisdom. On the other hand, perhaps we should slow
down on being serious all the time.

### Who is the guy in the picture?

That, is Giacomo!

### What is the Giacoconstant?

The Giacoconstant, G, can be calculated as such:

![Giacomonday constant](giacomonday_constant.png)

The 'plus one' is to emphasize that we are always
willing to read that one extra article.

### Don't you think a Monday is a bad day to go to a pub?

Yes. Some of the wiser visitors of Giacomonday thus leave at 22:00.

## History

### First era: 2014-2015

Giacomonday started in the era in which TECE was a member of COCON. In that era,
Richel Bilderbeek and Annelies van Ginkel were the two Party Committee members.
During that period, the pub was frequented once a week for six weeks in a row. Then,
Giacomo Alciatore, an examplary student went elsewhere. This resulted in Richel being
in the pub alone, and Giacomonday (not yet called as such) died a silent death. Also,
TECE split from COCON.

### Second era: 2016

In the second era, Giacomo visited Groningen for some weeks, and Giacomonday was
back! It was then named as such. When Giacomo left, Richel was again the only
one persevering in being social, and Giacomonday was put in the freezer.

### Third era: 2017-onwards

The TECE group has grown, with some new social members being added. Giacomonday
was revived, with Giacomono being absent (he does get the invitation 
email, though). The Giacomonday got an even more serious character, by 
adding a scientific topic to be informally discussed.
